## TODO


### Seem to have and issue with catastrophic forgetting
Things to explore:
- ~~update inference service to track model version for raw images~~
- ~~update processing pipeline to read current version and sample from all other versions~~
- ~~test~~
- ~~delete images from gcs to reset raw data~~
- ~~reset pipeline and start over at base model~~

Other Goals:
- MCP server for interpretations of model performance
