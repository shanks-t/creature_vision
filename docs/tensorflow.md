# Tensorflow Notes
- Transfer learning consists of taking features learned on one problem, and leveraging them on a new, similar problem.
- Transfer learning is usually done for tasks where your dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch

The most common incarnation of transfer learning in the context of deep learning is the following workflow:

1. Take layers from a previously trained model.
2. Freeze them, so as to avoid destroying any of the information they contain during future training rounds.
3. Add some new, trainable layers on top of the frozen layers. They will learn to turn the old features into predictions on a new dataset.
4. Train the new layers on your dataset.
